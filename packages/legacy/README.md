# `@quick-threejs/legacy`

`@quick-threejs/legacy` is a small library.
This lib was designed to quickly start a `ThreeJS` app. It'll set up a 3D scene with as little configuration as possible.

## ðŸš€ Quick start

Simply import `@quick-threejs/legacy` and instantiate it as follows:

```typescript
import QuickThreejs from "@quick-threejs/legacy";

let APP = new QuickThreejs(
	{
		axesSizes: 5,
		gridSizes: 10,
		enableDebug: true,
		withMiniCamera: true
	},
	"#experience"
);
```

That's it! Now you should see the following screen on your local development server preview:
