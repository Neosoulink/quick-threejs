# Quick-ThreeJS

Quick-threeJS is a small open-source library.
As its name says, the lib will quickly set up a 3D scene with as little configuration as possible.

## üöÄ Quick start

Simply import `quick-threejs` and instantiate it as follows:

```typescript
import QuickThreejs from "quick-threejs";

let APP = new QuickThreejs(
 {
  axesSizes: 5,
  gridSizes: 10,
  enableDebug: true,
  withMiniCamera: true,
 },
 "#experience"
);
```

That's it! Now you should see the following screen on your local development server preview:

> üí° The first parameter is the initialization properties and the second is the dom element reference.
